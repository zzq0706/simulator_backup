### Construction Site

1. Create your construction site using Terrain.
1. Attach [TerrainManager.cs](./Scripts/TerrainManager.cs) to the Terrain you have created.
1. Enter the parameters.

### Excavation Bucket

1. Add an empty child object to the excavation bucket.
1. Attach [ExcavateLine.cs](./Scripts/ExcavateLine.cs) to the object.
1. Enter the parameters.
1. Adjust the position of the object to the tip of the bucket. (Where the ExcavateLine can collide with the Terrain)

### Layer Setting

If the terrain and bucket collide, they will not work properly, so use the layer settings to prevent them from colliding with each other.
